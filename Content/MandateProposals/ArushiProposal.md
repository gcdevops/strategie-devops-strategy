Theme for the branch - Innovation and Experimentation 
>_The Strategic Framework identifies five themes that cut across the initiatives: Indigenous Reconciliation, Gender Impact and Equality, Vulnerable Groups, Policy-Service Integration, and Innovation and Experimentation._

## Vision of the branch
Towards strategic implementation of network architecture and management of digital products to fulfil government’s aspiration of delivering seamless digital services and prepare for future adoption of AI for autonomous decision-making and service delivery

## Priorities
- Governance and strategy focus include:
  * Design principles for IT governance (_could introduce a new bimodal governance structure here_)
  * Investment and priorities (_will help create a new category of innovation projects_)
  * Architecture (_prepare for the future_)
  * Infrastructure use (_manage resources_)
  * Client needs (_improve service delivery through adoption of advanced technologies_)
  * Client engagement (_collect feedback and develop trust among citizen for use of data_)

## Mandate 
- (POLICY) Providing oversight and guidance on governance processes for IT projects/initiatives
- (STRATEGY) Adoption strategy for modern/futuristic technology, including architecture design (enterprise, technical and solutions)
- (STRATEGY & PRIORITY) Direct research strategy and developmental efforts for DevOps
- (POLICY) Governing guidelines for use of AI and other autonomous decision-making technologies for service delivery
- (RESOURCE ALLOCATION) Mobilize resources to act as a bimodal synchronizer for efficient running of low risk record/standard practices alongside high risk innovation practices
	
## Activities
**_Policy and strategy development_**
- Initiate new programs/projects and secure required funding/resources
- Develop policies and program guidelines for digital products/services
- Create 3-year plan for research and development strategy for DevOps
- Ensure that ESDC’s technology programs/initiatives aligns with the themes of the strategic framework and priorities of the department  

**_Program(s) Management_**  
- Continuously monitor technology trends to keep pace with technological development
- Perform risk identification and risk management (modern and secure technology)
- Network architecture design  

**_Resource Allocation_**  
- Allocate resources between various projects/initiatives 
- Improve the sharing of information and resources between programs and across departments (How would bimodal work?)  

**_Organization Engagement_**  
- Create/lead a working group (_invites members from across organizations_) for gathering information on prevailing IT challenges
- Stimulate dialogues on the use of technology to improve services  

## Benefits of Mode 2 governance style
Adoption of lean culture and continuous/agile delivery practices for churning out new products and services
Initiate exploratory programs without sacrificing risk aversion governing nature
Tight alignment of programs with the branch priorities
Improves time-to-market and product evolution (Principle: "Fail fast")

Additional notes:
Decision-making – how will this change in the future? 
Citizen decision-making – the system makes choices for the person?
Autonomous governance – autonomous policy making
Privacy - Resonating with the North American view on privacy, where the citizens have freedom to opt for sharing of their personal data - Does this mean that citizens who do not share their data cannot access the upgraded services experience?
