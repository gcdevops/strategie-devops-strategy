## Background
_Current mandate of ESDC_: The mission of Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including the Labour Program and Service Canada, is to build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, to support Canadians in helping them live productive and rewarding lives and to improve Canadians’ quality of life

_Current role of ESDC_: ESDC offers a range of programs and services such as seniors with basic income security, supports unemployed workers, helps students finance their post-secondary education and assists parents who are raising young children. 

_Future role of ESDC_: Role of technology in human lives is redesigning the way we function daily. Global trends are fast changing the economic and political situations around the world – redistributing wealth, the nature of work and opportunities. Technology giants and social influence are changing human preferences and habits. Global market outlook suggests emergence of new job roles, occupations and industries. In the coming years and decades, perceptions of well being may reform to take new shape.  

~~Planning ahead will help Canada to respond and stay ahead of the technological curve rather than react to the changes around us.~~ In pursuit of improving quality of life for Canadians, ESDC needs to manage these changes in society and provide a support structure to prepare Canadians towards unprecedented risks and disruption from global participants. 
~~To safeguard the needs of Canadians and continuously improve their quality of life, ESDC should anticipate the needs and challenges of the future. ESDC should be prepared to redesign its programs and services to stay ahead to meet the changing needs of Canadians. ESDC should keep an open mind towards radical transformation of its program and service delivery practices to keep pace with the technological advances and prepare Canadians to take on more centric roles in the digital economy.~~


_Existing challenges in implementation_:
-	Existing governance policies and practices are proven for past programs and services. Due to shift in the software development and implementation practices, these policies and practices may not best suited for transformational technologies and initiatives
-	At a global stage, innovation is outpacing regulation, so Canadian laws and regulations around technology use may need to be redefined 
-	Data and information sharing may need to be revisited to address current privacy and security debates   


## Mandate
Our mandate is to architect and support implementation of a secure foundation of transformational technology to fulfil ESDC’s envision of human-centric service delivery in renewed social fabric, and forge a trust relationship among Canadians 

## Priorities of the branch
-	(GIVING VISION & STRATEGY) Envisioning and architecting a secure and central system to lay the foundation for digital transformation
-	(STRATEGY, PRIORITY & INVESTMENT) Providing foresight and prioritising investment on transformational service delivery programs 
-	(POLICY, NEW COOPERATION MODELS) Forge social partnerships with private sector for utilizing their business expertise and information to meet service delivery goals 
-	(STRATEGY & PRIORITY) Direct research strategy and developmental efforts for innovation teams such as DevOps
-	(POLICY) Initiate dialogues to continuously evolve on using next-generation technologies 
-	(POLICY) Recommend governing guidelines for the use of data and technologies 
-	(INTEROPERABILITY & RESOURCE ALLOCATION) Mobilize resources to support quick turn around time to deploy innovation practices, and act as a synchronizer for efficient running of existing practices alongside the new practices
-	(RISK AND COMPLIANCE) Develop guidelines for secure use of information and data during the implementation of transformational programs 
- Provincial cooperation?

## Activities
**_Policy and strategy development_**
-	Initiate new exploratory programs/projects and secure required funding/resources (_Who makes the submissions? Does each branch make their own submission? Does all submission go through CIO for approval first? Does IITB play a central role in project submissions? Within IITB is it Denis’s group that would do that?_)
-	Recommend policies and program guidelines for digital products/services (_Who approves or make decisions on policies?_)
-	Recommend suitable governance guidelines for exploratory programs/projects
-	Create 3-year plan for research and development strategy for DevOps (_How would DevOps be governed? Are they independent?_)
-	Ensure that ESDC’s technology programs/initiatives aligns with the themes of the strategic framework and priorities of the department
-	Develop adoption strategy for modern/futuristic technology, including architecture design (enterprise, technical and solutions)  

**_Program(s) Management_**
-	Continuously monitor technology trends to keep pace with technological development
-	Perform risk identification and risk management (modern and secure technology)
-	Network architecture design  

**_Resource Allocation_**
-	Allocate resources between various projects/initiatives 
-	Improve the sharing of information and resources between programs and across departments (How would bimodal work?)  

**_Organization Engagement_**
-	Coordinate with other departments to centralize use and allocation of IT resources 
-	Create/lead a working group (_invites members from across organizations_) for gathering information on prevailing IT challenges
-	Stimulate dialogues on the use of technology to improve services  

## Redesigning governance style
To keep pace with the digital habits of the citizens, ESDC needs to adopt technology at a much faster pace for service delivery. The IM and IT policies laid out by Treasury Board focuses on efficiency, stability and accuracy. Existing IM/IT governance style work well with projects associated with proven methodologies and technologies.   
However, it inherits some barriers for implementing exploratory projects. Exploratory projects are associated with innovating or experimenting to deliver a sudden transformation of business outcome. Redefining governance policies may be needed to promote:
-	Adoption of lean culture and continuous/agile delivery practices for churning out new products and services 
-	Initiate exploratory programs without sacrificing risk aversion governing nature 
-	Tight alignment of programs with the branch priorities 
-	Improves time-to-market and product evolution (Principle: "Fail fast")
-	Make innovation a sustainable process

## Redefining the services 
Examples of new/emergent services:  
-	Skills accreditation:  To compete with the global workforce, giving standard accreditation to Canadian skills may ease the workforce recognition at a global stage. It also helps in creating a Canadian brand in different industries  
-	Social and corporate influence: It is nearly impossible to foresee social and corporate influence on Canadians lives in the coming future. Emergence of digital value chain, commoditisation of many skills/services and pervasiveness of data-centric applications are influencing human choices and needs. Sharing of data among government, businesses and individuals may seem natural and need of the hour. Government role in such a place may give rise to new services to individuals and businesses.   
-	Future anticipation: With perceived wide scale adoption of AI and other technologies, there would a general displacement in the nature of work. This may require the citizens to retrain or learn new skills. ESDC can play a huge role in allaying the fears of citizens by anticipating their training and well-being needs through data-centric applications.

To work on:

Mainstream economics has worked on the theory of scarcity … and now with the abundance of information around there is a shift seen in the commoditization of the digital goods/services … An economic system of abundance
Universal access to information –
Employment and education pegged on skills and interests … new challenges may emerge such as job polarisation or wage inequality or outdated skill set of a group of people or sudden demand fluctuation -- labour mobility -^bridge from work to work
major structural changes to the economy
economic growth and employment rate
The population is growing and its life expectancy is increasing. At the same time, the cost of health care and care for the elderly will continue to grow and cause pressure to create solutions for proactive health care and disease prevention. Artificial intelligence and other technologies facilitate many opportunities for developing new solutions. At the same time, we can significantly improve the efficiency of healthcare pro-cesses as well as support the work of doctors and healthcare staff.
Finland has internationally unique healthcare data resources, the correct and appropriate utilisation of which will facilitate the development of unique solutions for the global market as well as for improving human wellbeing. Wellbeing is a rapidly growing market in western countries: there is a need for solutions that can support the wellbeing of people on a more extensive scale and proactively intervene in less acute phenomena that hinder people's wellbeing, such as social exclusion. 
… employment training  …  businesses are given money to hire an unemployed person to train … pedagogical initiatives
Regulatory sandbox
Joint contribution for companies to work with government--- This work will also aim to ensure the adoption of the public sector’s new cooperation models, -- Public administration’s structure, division of power and resources will no longer be able to respond to changing global problems.
Centres of applied sciences –- mitacs program
social cohesion and open debate between different population groups
Various data must function together – “A neural network study will be launched as part of the Joint Metadata and Information Management (YTI) programme. The study will look into the ability of artificial intelligence to create the semantic interoperability of data in place of manual determination work and symbolic modelling.” – Data for public interest … India: a National AI Marketplace to increase market discovery and reduce time and cost of collecting data, and a number of initiatives to help the overall workforce acquire skills…. Strategically, the government wants to establish India as an “AI Garage,” meaning that if a company can deploy an AI in India, it will then be applicable to the rest of the developing world.
Worldwide megatrends also create many opportunities for the utilisation and application of artificial intelligence. The best way to gain access to these is via public-private partnerships, in other words, via cooperation between the private and public sectors.
