## Background and intent

In the past, IT initiatives proposals were planned for a 5/10 year implementation cycle with total costs of the initiatives running over $1 billion easily. While this may seem like a prudent choice, the technological evolution is happening at a much faster rate. Recent examples have proved that the total costs of IT projects are difficult to gauge and there may be unforeseeable challenges in the implementation over a long run.

Prior experience teaches that IT projects are better delivered when implemented in a phased manner. Each sequential phase delivering the next product version, implementing improved functionality and upgrades.

This proposal is to suggest to adopt a sequential approach for IT projects approval reflecting the different phases of the projects.  

For example, a project may make sequential Treasury Board Submissions reflecting different implementation phases.

## Details of IT Project phases

**Prototyping > Scale-up > Ongoing Maintenance & Upgrades**

**_Prototyping_**

Prototyping represents the phase where the product`s core functionality is build. The outcomes of this phase may include an operational prototype ready-to-be implemented. The learnings of this project will help respond to the actual needs of the changing environment and plan for the next phases.

The costs of this phase may be marginal as compared to total cost of the project/initiative.

**_Scale-up_** 

Scale-up represents the phase where the product is developed as a complete package of functionalities and supported infrastructure is introduced to manage the clientele. 

**_Ongoing Maintenance & Upgrades_** 

Every software product needs continuous maintenance and upgrades to meet new safety and quality standards.

## Details of sequential proposal approach

The sequential proposal approach (such as creating sequential TB Submissions for an initiative) will enable in creating a more responsive project plan to accommodate the changes based on the outcomes of each project phase.
