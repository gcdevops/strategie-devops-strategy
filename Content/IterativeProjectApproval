## Need for reinventing Treasury Board Submissions process

Rightly so, the initiatives are designed to align well with Government of Canada priorities. Further, these initiatives are designed in a manner to meet the intended results while optimizing the use of resources. 

However, with the foreseeable exponential growth in the advance technology in the coming years and decades, the initiatives need to flexible in design to adapt to the changing environment and respond to it. Using the experience of previous government digital projects, along with extracting lessons learned in resource management strategies from the industry, the implementation processes could be reinvented to simplify the TBS process and promote quicker execution/implementation all while managing the risks and security concerns entailing these projects.

## Summary of the new proposed TBS iterative process

High-stake projects/initiatives need exhausting due diligence to foresee the impacts and outcomes of the projects. Where this may have worked in the past, the fast-evolving technological space need a more responsive project plan to accommodate the nature of changes. Therefore, we propose to introduce a sequential submission request for approvals as opposed to a single (existing) submission for the project. Sequential submissions are a good way to analyze the alignment of organizations activities with Government of Canadaâ€™s priorities.

These sequential submission requests may be similar in nature how a digital startup finances throughout its product lifecycle. 

A digital project lifecycle may include the following stages --- Incubation > Sandboxing > Scale-up

Sandboxing is not just validation of the conceptual idea to solve the problem, it also offers a check-point for whether the problem picked up in the first place is the right one. Sandbox projects allow to collect real data and evaluate the results of the core functionality of the product. 
This enables the team 
- To better understand the core problem to be solved 
- Provides customer validation
- Identify any gaps or challenges for large scale implementation 
- Improves early integration of security features
- Presents a chance to learn and pivot (for example, job listing may not be the core problem anymore as several alternatives are present. The problem may lie in finding a better match based on competencies, ways to be more inclusive in hiring or support to people to better apply to these jobs etc.)
