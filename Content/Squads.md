## Summary 

Within Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), as there are within the Government of Canada (GoC) at large, there is a call to modernize IT services and improve the quality of services offered to Canadians. Teams and individuals who have risen to the challenge and demonstrated results should be given the opportunity to share their accomplishments throughout the organization. Furthermore, proved performers should encouraged to spread their knowledge to their colleagues in order to ensure more evenly distributed growth within the organization, and to ensure the organization learns as a whole.

## Goals

- To increase interdepartmental and intergovernmental coordination, and organizational learning and capabilities
- To enable organizations to complete rapid prototyping 

## Background 

Similar initiatives to the one proposed have been adopted within the GoC and abroad. [Budget 2017](https://www.budget.gc.ca/2017/docs/plan/chap-01-en.html#Toc477707371) reads, pertaining to Canadian Digital Services (CDS) "Informed by similar initiatives in the U.S. (the U.S. Digital Service/18F) and the United Kingdom (the Government Digital Service), the Government will adopt new ways of serving Canadians. Better use of digital technologies could improve the ways in which businesses can access government services, speed up immigration processing times through better-integrated information, or make it easier for Canadians to access benefits or tax information online."

In the same spirit, our method below aims to make better use of existing resources to ensure the delivery of better services to Canadians through leveraging modern technologies. 
 
## Method 

Through leveraging existing communities and expertise managers should allow their team members (including students) to 
	- Participate in collaborative working groups as part of their work 
	- Allow them to contribute to a short term project required by a team under separate management 

Team members, coordinated through existing collaborative efforts throughout the GoC (Ex: Agora or the GC Dev Ops League) could be leveraged in order to quickly unite and leverage expertise in order to quickly prototype modern solutions for GoC departments. 

Due to the brief nature of the work, it is crucial that no administrative overhead restrict progress of the initiative. In order to address this need, in order to be eligible for this exchange (henceforth referred to as a mission) the manager responsible for initiating the process is implicitly agreeing for the resulting project to be hosted in a widely accessible source control repository, such as [gccode](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/users/sign_in) or [github](https://github.com/), depending on the requirements and preferences of the host department. This method allows for the team who will be completing the project to continue working as they were prior to the agreement. Additionally, it ensures that each mission may pull from talent originating from a variety of different sources, regardless of their department, or geographic location. By leveraging source control in this way, we are also aligning ourselves with the stance of the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) with respect to the use of Open Source Software (OSS) and working in the open initiatives. 

CDS's role has been to largely assist government departments by taking on key projects. Though the goals are simimlar, to improve the quality and rate of delivery of services to canadians, this proposed initiative compliments ongoing initiatives in the following ways 

- Missions must be developed in the open
- Missions can be developed from expertise spanning different departments 
- Missions must be completed within very brief time periods 
- Focus will be on rapid prototyping and quickly transfering required knowledge to host department  

We define rapid prototyping as strictly less than one week (with the option of an extension if necessary)
