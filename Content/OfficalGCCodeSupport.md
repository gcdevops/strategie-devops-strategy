# Official GC/Code Support

## Purpose

To recommend the adoption of a decentralized version control system for all IT personnel in order to enable wider collaboration within the Government of Canada as well as support advanced and modern DevOps capabilities.

## Context

The latest updates to the [Directive on Management of IT](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249) have clearly identified 3 main requirements changes related to source code management in the GoC:

1. If a custom-built application is the appropriate option, **by default any source code written by the government must be released in an open format via Government of Canada websites and services designated by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat** [(C.2.3.8.3)](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249#claC.2.3.8.3);
2. **All source code must be released under an appropriate open source software license** [(C.2.3.8.4)](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249#claC.2.3.8.4);
3. Share code publicly when appropriate, and when not, **share within the Government of Canada** [(C.2.3.9.5)](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249#claC.2.3.9.5).

The use of source code version control is indeed a foundational tool for software development but each department currently manages its own source code independently. Moreso, there are even instances where multiple methods and solutions are in place to manage source code versioning within a single organisation.

However, as IT infrastructure, environments and processes become more complex and abstract, new tools and roles are emerging. Information Technology world leaders and best practices promote the use of automation and development tools throughout the lifecycle of an application, not only through the coding phase.
In order to properly leverage this modern approach, a decentralized version control system with collaborative capabilities is vital.

Many opportunities present themselves for individual departments (reference the [ESDC Development Community's GC Code Recommendation article](https://github.com/esdc-edsc/Welcome/blob/master/Recommendations/GCcode.md)), though for the Government of Canada as a whole as well.
With initiatives such as the OneGov movement and the GCTools from TBS, having a collaborative tool with powerful automation features available would deliver great benefits to our development communities, who are increasingly responsible for ensuring the delivery of modern services to Canadians.
By providing a common place to develop and share development projects and solutions, there is an exceptional opportunity to reuse the same platform across departments in most cases.
Presently many redundancies exist within departments as they each host and support local instances of varying source control solutions.

## Existing literature

1. ESDC's Developer Community has written an [article](https://github.com/esdc-edsc/Welcome/blob/master/Recommendations/GCcode.md) promoting GC/Code as their preferred solution for a standardized source control.
The main set back of the tool is that it is unofficially supported, though given its benefits, ESDCs IT Strategy recommends that it should become the officially supported standard for all of the Government of Canada
2. A [wiki page](https://wiki.gccollab.ca/GCcode/ConceptCase) was written supporting the move towards a government wide standardized source control solution and makes a case for GC/Code.
The proposed initiative from the article is an integration of GC/Code within the GCTools suite
3. The Government of Canada Open Source Advisory Board started writing a [business case](https://github.com/canada-ca/OS-Advisory_Conseil-SO/blob/master/en/Working_Group_Tools/gc-source-code-repo.md) for a Source Code Platform to enable central hosting and sharing of source code.

## Situation

GC/Code is an instance of [GitLab Community Edition (CE)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/), free open source software (FOSS) under the MIT license, hosted by Shared Services Canada (SSC).
GC/Code is currently unofficially supported by SSC with a "when time permits" policy.
It runs on production servers and has backups and receives semi-regular updates.
GC/Code is currently only available within the GoC Intranet, which does block the solution from access to 3rd party add-ons and some native features.
A number of departments are already storing a large amount of source code on GC/Code as their main source control solution.

### GC/Code Stats

**As of May 29th, 2019** GC/Code has a record of:
<!-- not all stats may be needed for this, but listing them all for now -->
* 3,614 projects
* 2,998 users
* 2,996 active users
* 507 groups
* 317 forks
* 741 milestones
* 17,280 issues
* 8,778 merge requests
* 155,596 notes
* 394 snippets
* 300 SSH Keys
* 50 distinct email domains (aka GC Organizations)

## Business case

To bring [GC/Code](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca) as an officially supported source control solution for the Government of Canada's developer community.

### Improved Feature Support

With the current (as is) configuration of GC/Code, there are a few additional features that could be enabled to increase the viability of the tool:

* **[Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/)** - To host documents and guides on the software in development, and even static websites including ones with GoC official theme.
* **Shared [Runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/)** - For deployment directly to SSC infrastructure to manage production and development environments.

With the tool exposed to the internet, there are a few other features that could be leveraged:

* **[Runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/)** - For deployment to cloud infrastructure to manage production and development environments.
* **3rd Party [Integrations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/integration/)** - To add a variety of services to projects.
* **[Repository mirroring](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/workflow/repository_mirroring.html)** - For multi-government and citizen collaboration.

With funding for the [GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee), even more [features](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/self-managed/feature-comparison/) could be available.

### Why GC/Code and not GitHub?

There are arguments to support the adoption of GitHub over GC/Code. Mainly:

* **Leveraging the GitHub's infrastructure**
The GC will not be able to compete with GitHub's resources and its ability to stay current, so it would be best to use GitHub from the get go and benefit from its sustainability capability.
* **Work in complete openness**
GitHub allows GC employees to work in complete openness with the rest of the world, turning repositories private only when needed.

However, this proposal counters these arguments to the favour of GC/Code for the following reasons:

* **Increase comfort level to openness**
Some GC employees and IT Security personnel are reluctant to use GitHub due to security risks (e.g.: [accidently adding sensitive information like API keys in the repos](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/02/07/uber_quit_github_for_custom_code_after_2016_data_breach/)).
Using GC/Code is expected to augment the GC developer's community best practices around source control and, as such, increase assurance around management and IT Security personnel for open source project meant to be released to the public.
* **Vendor lock-in risk management**
GitHub roadmap is determined based on industry funding, not by the GC's interests. Having our own internal instance reduces vendor lock-in by allowing GitHub repositories a second home.
* **Potential Cost Savings**
Although a more fullsome cost evaluation should be performed when this proposal is adopted, it is believed that maintaining an internal instance would result in cost savings due to the requirement to host private repositories at the GC level.
* **Contribute to [GitLab Community Edition (CE)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/)**
Having a hosted version of GitLab allows the GC to contribute more directly to the GitLab open source project.

## Potential Funding Options

SSC and PSPC-Digital Services Branch are two Departments mandated with providing these types of services to other Government Departments, however both SSC and PSPC-DSB exist within a cost recovery funding model. In order to move forward on this recommendation, it is likely that we will need to identify Departments interested in providing resources to support this recommendation. Below are some potential options:

* Each department which leverages GC/Code provides one employee who is responsible one day a week to contribute towards the maintenance and constant improvement of the GitLab instance
* A flat fee per user per department is charged to those departments using the service
