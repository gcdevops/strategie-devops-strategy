## Summary 

ESDC's Developer Community has promoted GCCode as their preferred solution for a standardized source control 

http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/ESDC_Development_Community_-_GC_Code_Recommendation

The main set back of the tool is that it is unofficially supported, though given its benefits, ESDCs IT Strategy recommends that it should become the officially supported standard for all of the Government of Canada 

## Background 

The use of source control is a foundational tool for development. As IT infrastructure and processes become ever more complex, new tools and roles are emerging. Information Technology world leaders and best practices promote the use of automation and development tools throughout the lifecycle of an application. In order to properly leverage this modern approach, a shared source control instance is vital. Many opportunities present themselves for individual departments (reference the ESDC Development Community`s GC Code Recommendation article), though for the Government of Canada as a whole as well. With initiatives such as the OneGov movement from TBS, having a collaborative tool with powerful automation features available, will deliver great benefits to our development communities, who are increasingly responsible for ensuring the delivery of modern useable tools to Canadians.
